Give proper datatypes to DB and FORMS.  SQlite alright for final version?

Can anyone claim to be any author ID?  Or grab an ID associated with a user name?
Why need to create a seperate type of account for reader and author?  Oh well. . .

Extend username model/class to include info about user type and the author's ID if author.
ask for authorID on field but disable input and populate automatically?  Or remove?

Why not search author's by username not ID?

fix bug when creating duplicate usernames.
